# My Claude Code Project's Starter Settings

My Claude Code project's starter settings and Claude Code hooks and slash commands are provided in this repository for users to try out. Be sure to read the official Claude Code docs first at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview and sign up for a [paid Claude AI account](https://claude.ai/) to use Claude Code. You can pay for Claude Pro $20/month, Claude Max $100/month or Claude Max $200/month. The paid Claude tier plans will include varying quotas for usage and rate limits outlined [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices).

1. Copy the files in this Github repo to your project directory (where you intended codebase will be).
2. Modify the template files and `CLAUDE.md` to your liking. `.claude/settings.json` needs to install Terminal-Notifier for macOS https://github.com/centminmod/terminal-notifier-setup. If you're not using macOS, you can remove `.claude/settings.json`.
3. After launching Claude Code for the first time within your project directory, run `/init` so that Claude Code analyses your code base and then populates your memory bank system files as per `CLAUDE.md` instructions.
4. Optional step highly recommended: Install Visual Studio Code ([beginners YouTube video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPITZvwyoMc) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5bWpUbO60)) and [Claude Code VSC Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code).
5. Optional step highly recommended: Sign up for [Github.com](https://github.com/) account and install Git for Visual Studio Code. Checkout YouTube guides [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twsYxYaQikI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jZ9lrSpqk).

I also install the following MCP servers ([install commands](#claude-code-mcp-servers)):

* [Gemini CLI MCP](https://github.com/centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server)
* [Cloudflare Documentation MCP](https://github.com/cloudflare/mcp-server-cloudflare/tree/main/apps/docs-vectorize)
* [Context 7 MCP](https://github.com/upstash/context7)
* [Notion MCP](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server)

## Claude Code Hooks

The Claude Code hook is for `STOP` which uses Terminal-Notifier to show macOS desktop notifications whenever Claude Code stops and finishes it's response https://github.com/centminmod/terminal-notifier-setup.

## Claude Code Subagents

Claude Code subagents are specialized tools designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. A key benefit of Claude Code subagents is that uses its own context window separate from the main conversation and can use it's own custom prompt.

## Claude Code settings

> Configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using the interactive REPL.

### Settings files

The `settings.json` file is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory:
  * `.claude/settings.json` for settings that are checked into source control and shared with your team
  * `.claude/settings.local.json` for settings that are not checked in, useful for personal preferences and experimentation. Claude Code will configure git to ignore `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.

#### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

| Key                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Example                         |

2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings

### Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session, or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or organization.

### Configuration options

We are in the process of migrating global configuration to `settings.json`.

`claude config` will be deprecated in place of [settings.json](#settings-files)

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

* List settings: `claude config list`
* See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
* Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
* Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
* Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default `config` changes your project configuration. To manage your global configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

#### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

| Key                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        | Example                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoUpdates`           | Whether to enable automatic updates (default: `true`). When enabled, Claude Code automatically downloads and installs updates in the background. Updates are applied when you restart Claude Code. | `false`                                                                    |

### Tools available to Claude

Claude Code has access to a set of powerful tools that help it understand and modify your codebase:

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#available-settings).

#### Extending tools with hooks

You can run custom commands before or after any tool executes using
[Claude Code hooks](/en/docs/claude-code/hooks).

For example, you could automatically run a Python formatter after Claude
modifies Python files, or prevent modifications to production configuration
files by blocking Write operations to certain paths
